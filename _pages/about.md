My name is Anh-Thu Le (Thu, for simplicity). I am a PhD student at the VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center (VISHC), VinUniversity starting Fall 2025. I work under the guidance of Prof. [Khoa D. Doan](https://mail-research.com) and co-advised by Prof. [Wray Buntine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J2pGGuAAAAAJ&hl=vi) and Prof. [Hong Chu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZLXxF3YAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research focuses on Vision-Language Model (VLM) for medical image diagnosis, including making these model more efficiently (compression/ quantization), more interpretable (mechanistic interpretation) uncertainty-aware, etcâ€¦

I received a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh (HCMUS). I got 3.8 GPA with absolute thesis score and graduated earlier than regular program. 

Before joining PhD program, I have had experience in Applied AI in Computer Security with 2 years as Research Assistant in the Computer Security lab under guidance of Dr. [Minh-Son Dao](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=YO1M4t8AAAAJ&hl=vi) (NICT, Japan), Prof. [Duc-Tien Dang-Nguyen](https://dnductien.github.io/) (University of Bergen, Norway) and Dr. [Anh-Duy Tran](https://pakkunandy.github.io/) (Ku Leuven, Belgium). During this time, I published two papers as first/co-first author: one in ACM ICMR 2024 and one in IEEE Access (Q1 journal), focusing on multimedia verification.

Outside of research, I enjoy sports, outdoor activities, and reading.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email for collaboration or simply to connect. I truly love what I do and am always open to meaningful conversations on how we can make a positive impact together.
